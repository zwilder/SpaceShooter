# Space Shooter

It's the year 3057, and you find yourself deep in the uncharted reaches
of Sector Zeta-9. As a rookie space cadet, you're armed with a second-rate
mining ship and a dream of striking it rich in the asteroid fields of the
illustrious United Planets Mining Consortium. But there's one detail they
conveniently left out when you signed up: these asteroids are home to a race of
crystalline aliens, and they really donâ€™t appreciate you blowing their world to
bits.

Good luck, cadet.
